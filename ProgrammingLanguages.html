Sometimes abbreviated as HLL, a high-level language is a computer programming language that isn't limited by the computer, designed for a specific job, and is easier to understand.<br/> It is more like human language and less like machine language. However, for a computer to understand and run a program created with a high-level language, it must be compiled into machine language.<br/>
The first high-level languages were introduced in the 1950s. Today, high-level languages are in widespread use. These include BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, Java, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Visual Basic.
